# Pizza Menu

## Setting Up a Project with Create-React-App

Now Create-React-App tool is a command line interface tool.
In project folder run this command from CMD  
**npx create-react-app@5 pizza-menu**

By running this we have all of the files and folder that we usually see with ***npm init***  

We also have two folders src and public.  
Most of our development work will happen inside the source folder(src). And a public is where all the assets(images/index.html file/icons... ) that will end up in the final application go.
